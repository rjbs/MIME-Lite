This is MIME::Lite 3.01_01 Test Maintenance Release
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST RELEASE
    Please be WARNED that this is a test release and should NOT be blindly
    put into production. I would appreciate any and all feedback as to
    whether any problems occur in using it, especially as I have no way
    currently to test sendmail functionality.

INSTALLATION
    Install using

      perl makefile.pl
      make test
      make install

    Or instead of the last line, even better is

      make install TEST_VERBOSE=1

    Adjust the make command as is appropriate for your OS. 'nmake' is the
    usual name under Win32

    In order to read the docmentation please use

      perldoc MIME::Lite

    from the command line or visit

      http://search.cpan.org/search?query=MIME%3A%3ALite&mode=all

    for a list of all MIME::Lite related materials including the
    documentation in HTML of all of the released versions of MIME::Lite.

BUNDLED GOODIES
    MIME::Lite comes with a number of extra files in the distribution
    bundle. This includes examples, and utility modules that you can use to
    get yourself started with the module.

    The ./examples directory contains a number of snippets in prepared form,
    generally they are documented, but they should be easy to understand.

    The ./contrib directory contains a companion/tool modules that come
    bundled with MIME::Lite, they dont get installed by default. Please
    review the POD they come with.

OTHER MODULES
    MIME::Lite works nicely with other certain other modules if they are present.
    Good to have installed is the latest MIME::Types, Mail::Address MIME::Base64.

BUGS
    Should tests fail please review the ./testout directory, and in any bug
    reports please include the output of the relevent file. This is the only
    redeeming feature of not using Test::More that I can see.

    Bug fixes / Patches / Contribution are welcome, however I probably won't
    apply them unless they also have an associated test. This means that if
    I dont have the time to write the test the patch wont get applied, so
    please, include tests for any patches you provide.
